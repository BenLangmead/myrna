- Stop using 'hadoop' script

Use of 'hadoop' script from within the streaming jobs is problematic because it
spins up a new JVM, and it requires that we know where 'hadoop' is.  For the
'hadoop dfs' commands, maybe there's a lighter-weight tool, like an efficient
Perl or Python interface, that we can use instead.  Alternately, maybe we can
wrap our streaming tools using Java instead of Perl, giving us access to the
Hadoop APIs and (hopefully) not requiring a new JVM.

- Getting counters is slow

Why do we try to retrieve counters programatically and store them?  Mostly I
think because EMR doesn't save them for us and they're a useful debugging tool.
(Actually, EMR does save them if you specify a log URI, but they're in an
unreadable, unsummarized format.)

But James G points out that this can be slow in Hadoop mode when there are a
large number of archived jobs in the Hadoop log.  But this feature is also not
very necessary in Hadoop mode because the user can just check the jobtracker.

So maybe we can just turn this feature off in Hadoop mode.
