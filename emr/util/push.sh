# Run from Myrna root directory (i.e. sh emr/util/push.sh X.Y.Z
# where X.Y.Z is version).  Puts all of the Perl-script intrastructure
# into place.  Doesn't do anything about the binaries.  You either have
# to push those yourself or use the pull_push.sh script to move
# everything from one version to another first.  The S3CFG environent
# variable must be set to an appropriate .s3cfg file (config file for
# s3cmd).
