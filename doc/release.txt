How to release a new version of Myrna
=====================================

Changing the Ensembl version used:
- For each script in the reftools subdirectory:
  + Change the ENSEMBL_VER variable at the top of the script to reflect new
    version
  + Check whether the naming scheme for the FASTA files has changed.  I.e. go
    look in ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-<rel>/fasta/<species_name>/dna
    and if the name doesn't look like the one in the ENSEMBL_PREFIX variable,
    update the variable.
  + Check whether the list of chromosomes in the ftp directory matches the list
    placed into the CHRS_TO_INDEX variable.
- Build all the jars using the scripts in the reftools subdirectory.  Perhaps
  use the sge.sh script to build them simultaneously on an SGE cluster.
- Upload all the jars to s3://myrna-refs/.  Make sure they are world-readable.
- Update webui/myrna.pl to refer to the new jars and the new Ensembl version.
- Update MANUAL.markdown to refer to the new jars and the new Ensembl version.

Changing the R version used:
- Change R_VER at the top of the R/build_r script
- Change $R_VER in MyrnaIface.pm
- Build R using R/build_r, then package it up in a tarball and upload to the
  s3://myrna-emr/<ver> directory.  Made it world-readable.
- Update the manual to refer to the new R version

Changing the Bowtie version used:
